Women education is a catch all term which refers to the state of primary, secondary, tertiary and health education in girls and women. All the countries of the world, especially the developing and underdeveloped countries must take necessary steps to improve their condition of female education; as women can play a vital role in the nationâ€™s development. The stronger the roots are the bigger and stronger the tree will be spreading its branches; sheltering and protecting the needy. Women are the soul of a society; a society can well be judged by the way its women are treated. An educated man goes out to make the society better, while an educated woman; whether she goes out or stays at home, makes the house and its occupants better. Women play many roles in a society- mother, wife, sister, care taker, nurse etc. An educated mother will make sure that her children are educated, and will weigh the education of a girl child, same as boys. A society cannot at all progress if its women weep silently.
